This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# package installs have been commented out. 
# if you already have installed, don't re-install for no reason!
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gapminder_table <- gapminder
gapminder_table
```

```{r summarize_the_data}
summary(gapminder_table)
```
```{r}
year_spread <- gapminder_table %>% 
  filter(year>1951) %>% 
  filter(country== "Afghanistan" | 
           country=="Ireland") %>% 
  select(country,year,lifeExp) %>% 
  spread(year, lifeExp)
year_spread
```
